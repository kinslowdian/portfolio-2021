						<p class="p-med">With an expected rise of entertainment purchases during the world cup, which wanted to highlight their product reviews and comparisons available to subscribers through online ads. I worked on these using some of the previous designed and animated icons, but giving them a little hint of the football theme that the current set style would allow. After a few tests with various ball illustrations, colour combination, animation styles I could then start creating and building these into the banner templates.<br><br>

						To really give the ball clairity, a white fill was added later in the development, and probably the only icon in the whole set to use this colour method, against the other dark filled with red highlights on details colour combination. Applications and skills used during the project: Javascript, Abobe Illustrator, and Adobe Animate.</p>

						<p class="p-med">With a new brand look devised and created for print by Grey, I was tasked with getting this new look and feel working within the digital space for the likes of social, online advertising, and digital outdoor spaces. The new look used very bold colours and simple icon graphics alongside bold impactful text. With the many services Which? has to offer to consumers led to the opportunity to develop new ones.<br><br>

						While creating these new icons, I could consider how they would animated and come to life at the same time, making the production of the creation and animation almost seamless. Applications and skills used during the project: Javascript, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Animate.</p>

					<div class="sk-showcase-desc">
						<p class="p-med">With the M&S tie up with the release of Paddington 2 for their Christmas ad, there was a push on social to get the Christmas campaign across all social channels. Involving short bumpers, boomerangs using footage from the main TV ad. More traditional methods followed with the social video suite to producing online banners, and an example for a production company to follow.<br><br>

						The turnaround time was very tight due to releasing this mix of social and digital advertising at the same time the TV ad went live. Applications and skills used during the project: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Animate, and Adobe After Effects.</p>

						<p class="p-med">To push more ticket sales, the Arrive Awesome campaign covered TV, press, outdoor, social, and digital advertising. Online the campaign resulted in 25 million online impressions, and the campaign on a whole increased revenue by £13.5 million. With my experience in Adobe Flash builds for advertising, this was to be my first introduction to HTML banners on the build side.<br><br>

						It was an immense challenge in getting everything to run correctly across multiple devices and multiple browsers, and to match the storyboards exactly. Workarounds and solutions were aplenty, and solving issues was very satisfying. I learnt a great deal about javascript development from this project, while working within the development team, and thankfully have never relied on jQuery again! Applications and skills used during the project: HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript.</p>

						<p class="p-med">Google presented many tips on how to stay safe online with personal information and security. To push that message further came in the form of a book that existed in various rich media placements. Artwork and illustrations from the campaign were all included to give a sketch book aesthetic to the overall design. Page turning of the book was refined and tested to keep the experience as rich and realistic as I could.<br><br>

						Along with a system that loaded in the pages dynamically to help filesize restraints with the media space. Different languages were also required for the campaign to run in Europe too. Applications and skills used during the project: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Flash. Developed in actionScript 3.0.</p>

					<div class="sk-showcase-desc">
						<p class="p-med">To advertise the miCoach training app for the iPhone, I was asked to take a concept and make it a reality with designing and building the ad. To entice users into watching the video I added hints of the promo with a few scenes, housed inside the polygon shapes used in other parts of the branding, with various other effects layered over on top.<br><br>

						The masthead placement on YouTube doesn’t match the ratio of the video so a little treatment was added to fill the space on the end sequence to bleed out to white for a neater lockup.

						<p class="p-med">I was briefed to design, animate, and build a masthead for nokia.com to advertise the new Nokia N8 smartphone. Asset wise for the project, we had access to 3D renders used in the TV adverts, mixing these in with the standard flash animation helped to push the rich ad placement, along with consistency to match the rest of the campaign.<br><br>

						Some random math scripting added some life into the background, with the cubes floating in various velocities throughout the duration. Applications and skills used during the project: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Flash, and Adobe After Effects. Developed in actionScript 2.0.</p>

					<div class="sk-showcase-desc">
						<p class="p-med">To direct traffic to the microsite I was involved in some rich ad placements that were expendable on roll over. Using video from various parts of the microsite I comped everything into a flow with cue points to trigger certain titling and text effects. Every aspect of the ad right down to small little UI hints, were designed and animated with as much detail as possible.<br><br>

						File size restrictions on collapsed parts of the placement meant animating a lot of the effects on the side of the shoe with the basic tools in Flash than using sequences or loops of video.
