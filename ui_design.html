					<div class="sk-showcase-desc">
						<p class="p-med">The key focus for all of this was to incorporate the latest brand guidelines into the main national grid family of sites, improve navigation and usability of tired templates, and make the website feel more current and richer if there was a need for it. I worked closely with a joint UI UX designer to help create a range of templates and together produce a UI kit outlining a whole library of new components with a consistent brand treatment. There were a lot of challenges to overcome, not just from a visual perspective but how some newer components could be maximised to be used on editorial pages instead of very informative ones.<br><br>

						Usability was considered at every point throughout the design process and this started within the UX. Towards the end of the project I also got involved in a discovery task, experimenting with some of the other pages and how they could adopt the new design through simple CSS editing with the global styles. This practice involved playing with the current site within the browsers dev tools, and manually adjusting the page to see what could be achieved. Along with design, prototyping, and interaction with the client side team throughout it was a project that pulled a whole range of my skill set.</p>

					<div class="sk-showcase-desc">
						<p class="p-med">My involvement in this project wasn’t the usual position of designing the UI, but focusing more on the build side taking the designs from a UI / UX designer within Shell New Motion and working with the developers to build the pages out in a third party app in BigCommerce. To match the design and style coming from the Zeplin links involved a fair amount of custom elements and modifying them with CSS, relying heavily on flex-box properties.<br><br>

						To help build the pages and to get the backgrounds and icons working correctly involved resorting away from the text editor and using Sketch and Photoshop to export assets to assist the build. This is the first project using such a dev tool intended for hybrid digital designers and enjoyed learning at speed alongside the daily tasks from the brief.</p>

I suggested to fully sell in the creative would be to prototype up a rich header using the design elements from sketch. The prototype was fairly quick to build with taking sliced up png’s from the Sketch files and building them into a web page with HTML & CSS that would use a scroll effect with the title overlaid on a looping video created in After After Effects.</p>

						<p class="p-med">Cohaesus was asked at the eleventh hour to help design and produce the festival website for one of the first EDM festivals in Saudi Arabia. Brand guidelines had been set for the festival artwork along with the social side, while the UI creation had some parameters to follow, but with a small creative team of myself, a videographer, and an art director based in New York we worked together to help make this the rich festival site they were originally hoping for.<br><br>

						A mobile first approach was employed as the usage of this website would be at the festival. For the tight deadline we relied on a wordpress theme to do some of the base styling, I had to keep this in mind while trying to not go off on a tangent with the UI design to help the development side of build. The project reached its deadline to do a reveal in the form of a counter and some other updated pages were added as a second phase. A range of tools were used over the course of the project such as Sketch, InVision, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

						<p class="p-med">From a client design workshop there was a requirement to fully flesh out some of the preferred concepts into an app that would cover the Handley House group of companies. This would work in the form of company intranet within a phone app. It would offer access to project briefs, a company - client chat functionality, news, inspiration project boards, and notifications all held in one place.<br><br>

						Stage one involved working closely with UX to scope out the pages along with research in similar online tools that do a similar task. Stage two led to fully creating the designs page by page in Sketch, once these were fully approved, I moved on to stage three to create the design as a rich animated experience using Framer. This project was quite a learning curve and lent on my Javascript skills with learning how to use the React API within Framer to best get the designs to flow and animate as intended. For sure this was the most technical project I have done to date.</p>

						<p class="p-med">This was an internal project to attempt to do ‘headless e-commerce” with big commerce, a member of the team’s other half was creating and selling home made chilli jam and the idea would be to add these into the set meal boxes of pastries, and other fresh food items sourced from Margate. Apart from the UI design of the main e-commerce site there were other tasks such as the branding with quick logo design, and the creation of packaging stickers in the form of address labels.<br><br>

						We worked in a small team to help concept logos and the site itself with useful ideation sessions. Being an internal project time was tight so we were all working at speed including the development. Adobe Illustrator was used for all the branding material while Sketch and Zeplin were relied on heavily to deliver the UI to the developers. The project led to further work for clients with Cohaesus being recommended by BigCommerce.</p>

						<p class="p-med">The brief requirement here was to push up sign ups to Aspria’s european health clubs and spas with a campaign landing page. This would be a one pager design with a seperate page for sign up form. Taking a few hints of the brand I was able to push the design with this creative, showing rich large photography to really highlight what the clubs had to offer.<br><br>

						The use of personalisation on this site was another feature, especially using the mobile version would give you a different header and other sections of difference depending where you were near. So the benefits of the local club would be pushed onto you more rather than a general page that covered them all. I worked closely with UX and development to help deliver this project along with the use of Sketch and InVision for presenting the UI concept to the client.</p>

I worked in collaboration with a UX designer and the Creative Director within Yoti, turning the wireframes into final designs ready to go into development, and being on hand for any design difficulties that arose during development.<br><br>

						As some core elements of the brand were remaining, I had to adopt and extend their current Design System within Sketch that evolved as each page was produced. InVision was used to communicate designs to the clients for creative review and sharing updates amongst the project team. Designs were shared with the overseas development team with Zeplin. Problem solving was key along the whole process especially with incorporating mobile designs alongside the desktop views. Applications and skills used during the project: Sketch, Creation of a sharable Design System, Illustrator, InVision, and Zeplin.</p>

A proposal to look at making the landing page more editorial was requested, pushing more than one article or link within the header, followed by further drink mixing content below within the rest of the page.<br><br>

						A second part to the project was to look at a new section within the site in the form of a hub of articles, that could be used as a blog. With a purpose of highlighting drink events, seasonal cocktails, recipes, and highlight various diageo products. A freeier approach was adopted with these layout compared to the more structured look and feel of thebar.com. Sadly none of these concepts came to light other than the split header on the current website. Nevertheless, It was a fun exercise in layout experiments. Applications and skills used during the project: Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.</p>

My first task involved the creation of the online hub and keeping a premium, easy to use style from the landing page, all the way through to the submit form.<br><br>

						I was heavily involved in the creative for online advertising after the hub design. To target as possible, the accompanying media was built both in Flash and the Celtra ad platform to allow rich animation on mobile and tablet devices using html / css.

In order to follow consistency and continue the design I set in place, the client agreed we needed an online hub to house a style guide that these new markets could refer to and follow during the creation of tailored content for their regions.<br><br>

						A very detailed look was included within the pages for interaction states, typography, form modules, pixel sizes, and how marketing emails would follow the design style of the parent site they were sent from. Research before the project involved in looking at best in class examples available from UX articles and blogs, to get an idea of how to make the pages as useful as possible to current leading standards and presenting the detailed information.

Design, UX and development worked closely within a small team over a period of a few months to be seamless in creating the site.<br><br>

						A key requirement was to present the user with information that was considered yet organised, and to avoid being text heavy. Focusing on full bleed imagery to highlight the premium products Infiniti were creating. Clear navigation, easy on the eye, and a strategy to simplify the user journey and to increase user engagement to eventually submitting their information for a possible test drive.

Working with an Art Director, and UX helped to keep the balance of a premium yet usable site.<br><br>

To create interest and provide information to potential customers about these new products, an idea was formed to create a microsite from scratch that lived inside adidas.com.<br><br>

						Featuring a one page site solution and having control over the UX, I decided on accordions and tabs to house the relative sections. With access to rich photography provided by adidas, made the process of achieving a premium look and feel much easier.

Here users could get an insight into the latest UI of the phone and see all other features and benefits with the product. After experimenting with the handset I went on to design and direct a style that matched the bold colours of the handset and take hints of the UI on the phone’s OS.<br><br>
